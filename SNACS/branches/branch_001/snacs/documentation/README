The SNACS sources need to be present in ../trunk for generating the SNACS
documentation. 

Run a "make clean mocclean" in the trunk directory, before you run doxygen.

To generate the HTML documentation, go to directory doxygen-sources and run doxygen there. 

The HTML documentation will be generated in the html/ directory. 

Open html/index.html to view it.
